# Inserting an Element at the Head of a Singly Linked List

 * create a new node,
    set its element to the new element,
    set its next link to the current head.
 * set the listâ€™s head to point to the new node.

# Inserting an Element at the tail of a Singly Linked List

 * same as inserting at the Head provided we keep a reference to the tail node.

# Removing an element from the head of a singly linked list
 * it's essentially the reverse operation of inserting a new element at the head.

# A circularly linked list is a linked list that its tail use its next reference to point back to the head of the list.
